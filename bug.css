The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not used carefully. For instance, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not produce the intended result if the parent element's width is not defined. This can occur due to the order of calculation and element rendering, sometimes resulting in an element being slightly larger or smaller than expected. Another common mistake is improper use of units within `calc()`. Mixing units without proper conversion can lead to unpredictable outcomes.  For example, `calc(100px + 10%)` is likely to produce an unexpected result.  Additionally,  incorrect nesting or complex calculations within `calc()` can become hard to debug and maintain.  Whitespace around operators within `calc()` is also crucial; incorrect spacing may lead to parsing errors.
